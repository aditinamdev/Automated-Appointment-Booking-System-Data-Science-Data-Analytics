# Automated-Appointment-Booking-System-Data-Science-Data-Analytics
Abstract—Appointment booking is a part of everyday life
nowadays. From booking movie show tickets to booking flight
seats everything is online. In recent times the pandemic has
brought some tough challenges before the healthcare systems
which include appointment booking. As hospitals and clinics
witness an overwhelming surge of patients the healthcare workers
are found to be overburdened. Oftentimes important calls made
by patients to the hospitals go unanswered or result in long
wait times. Speech is the primary mode of communication
among human beings. Many patients would prefer to call-in and
book an appointment before visiting the crowded hospitals. This
paper is focused on developing an AI voice bot which works
on call to communicate with patients and subsequently book
appointments and/or answer questions related to that hospital.
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is the process of deriving
the transcription of an utterance, given in the speech waveform.
This paper aims at completely automating the process of booking
appointments in general, all through voice recognition. Instead
of having to go through contact lists and learn different UIs,
patients can simply have a conversation with the bot through a
familiar interface. Not only will it book an appointment but also
study the patterns in the database and predict future inflow of
patients and suggest constructive advice for the system. This will
not only save patient’s critical time, but also reduce the burden
on healthcare workers and hence optimize the management of
patients and their appointments.
In this repository I've added data science Python files which processes the Realtime and Test datasets. Test dataset has been taken from Kaggle whereas Realtime dataset has been generated with the help of prospective patients. Exploratory Data Analysis has been performed along with various different visualizations in the form of histograms, scatterplots, barplots, heatmaps etc. Apart from these a Comparison python notebook has been added which weighs out the differences between the two datasets and gives the accuracy of the model.
